# chemX Tool
chemX is a tool developed using Excel VBA, in order to find out adiabatic flame temperature of Hydrogen-Air combustion for different pressures and equivalence ratio.

# Installation

- In order to used chemX, just download the 'chemX' file on your local drive (generally C:/)
- chemX requires Microsoft Excel (any version) in order to execute.
- Make sure 'Macro' is enabled in your security settings.(File-->Options-->Trust Center-->Macro Settings-->Enable all Macros)
- Also since chemX uses Excel solver for calculations, make sure 'Solver' is added-in. ((File-->Options-->Excel Add-ins-->Analysis ToolPak)

# Troubleshoot

- If there are multiple copies of the same file on your local drive, the solver might throw an error, due to mismatch between solver name. Kindly rename the file to the original file name 'chemX'
- If the solver does not work, kindly enable 'solver' in Excel VB. (Developer-->Visual Basic-->Tools-->References-->Solver)
